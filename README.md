## How we built
-We built this mobile application using Android Studio
-We used the lunacy to design UIs easily

## Challanges
-As you can see our team members, no one is majoring related the computer programs or languages. At first, we participated the Hack Arizona 2020 for fun, because we all are interested in computer languages. Over time, we decided to do the coding to know how much we like or want to learn about computer. We all are beginners but did make our project called, BestService-AmericanAirline, by asking through the Slack and googling tons of times.

## What we got
-Getting more insterested in computer languages
-Thankful for those who made mobile application to make customers more conveniently
